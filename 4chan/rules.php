				1. In mature threads, be mature, in retarded threads, be a retard! It's quite simple, and yes you can all tell the difference (thanks for that idea handy &lt;3).
				<br><br>
				2. Do NOT star flame wars with other boards. Everyone is intitled to their opinion, I just don't want this board being crapped up by 12
				year old losers going on anti-4chan jihads. Before you link on another site, think to yourself, "Is this post provoking? I guess I could take out 'EAT SHIT LOSERS 4CHAN4LIEF!' part...".<br><br>
				3. Post images in the appropriate boards. All off-topic posts will be removed, and repeated offenders will also be removed. It's not hard folks; thanks!

				1. Don't draw stupid things like goatse, we've all seen it. HURR HURR!
				<br><br>
				2. Oekaki BBS is a place to improve your skills as an artist, and show off your work to others. All works are welcome, however if possible try to keep the stick figure type stuff to a minimum. Have a slight degree of artistic talent or motive before you keep posting.<br><br>
				3. Don't bash other people's work (unless it's something like goatse). Constructive criticism is always welcome, however "HAHA THAT LOOKS LIKE CRAP" is not. Use discretion.<br><br>
				If you have talent and would like to moderate this board, shoot me an <a href="mailto:moot@raspberryheaven.net ?subject=Oekaki Mod">e-mail</a> with a sample work and any information you think would help you land the job.

				2. This won't be moderated alot, so keep things in order. Keep your random crap on /b/, and alternative crap on /d/, etc.<br><br>
				3. Pedo-rific pictures are perfectly fine. I don't care what you post here, as long as it is "cute".<br><br>
				4. Before posting ask yourself, "Should this go on /c/... or maybe /h/?", as there has been an influx of posts that could have gone either way. Use your own judgement.<br><br>
				NOTE: Nudity is PERFECTLY okay on this board. If it is cute and nude, post it here, and not on /h/. Pictures like <a href="http://img.4chan.net/h/src/1065672781340.jpg">this</a> 
				and <a href="http://img.4chan.net/h/src/1065673197194.jpg">this</a> are fine for /c/. Maybe I should split /c/ into two boards, one for nudity and one for no nudity.

				<br><br>
				2. Keep ALL grotesque content on this board, even if it's yaoi, it should go here and not on /y/.<br><br>

				2. Just like /w/, this will be moderated. Do not post about your Saturday vacation plans here, as it will be promptly removed.<br><br>
				3. Sadly there will be no dickgirlz (except Bridget) or yaoi allowed in this forum. Keep the pedo-rific content to a minimum as well, and make sure the images portray someone noticably in their teens. See /c/ and /d/ for alternatives to this board.<br><br>

				5. Try to include as much information as possible about a picture. If you know the girl's name, artist's name, manga name, anime name, etc., post it so that others may find more!

				1. Beautiful or sexy women only please!<br><br>

				6. ABSOLUTELY NO UNDERAGE CONTENT. As long as the underaged person is clothed (no visable pink), it is fine to post, however all nudity must be of persons 18+. <i>Violations will be promptly deleted, and other more severe action will be taken if necessary.</i><br><br>

				should be appealing.<br><br>
				2. This board will be moderated to a degree higher than the other boards. Do not post off-topic or stupid posts here. It

				stuffing your mouth with McDonald's food; we don't want to see it.<br><br>
				3. Wallpapers should be distinctly anime or J-pop related. They can be real world pictures, just make sure they're noticably tied 
				to Japanese culture. A seperate "anything goes" wallpaper may be added at a later date and time if this one is recieved well.
