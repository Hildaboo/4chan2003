				<td id="newsbody">Just throwing out an update for the people that actually read the main page. We hit ~9000 unique sessions in six days, with over one million hits! I'm very impressed, 
				I never thought 4chan would get this popular so fast. You have have to remember, it's not like I'm going out of my way advertising left and right, in fact I've only posted the site on two or so boards...<br><br>
				One thing I'd like to bring up is image leeching. I have no problem with you showing your friends pictures, or linking to them on forums. I do however have a problem with actually leeching the 
				images on websites or other boards, simply because there isn't enough bandwidth for that. Scripts such as 2chtrawl are technically allowed (as I have no robots.txt or .htaccess restrictions), however I'd prefer 
				people not use them.<br><br>
				Two new image boards were added, and the <a href="../rules.php">rules</a> updated:<br>
				<a href="../g/imgboard.php">/g/ - Guro</a><br>
				<a href="../s/imgboard.php">/s/ - Sexy Beautiful Women</a><br><br>
				These two boards are the second and third user managed boards, and mark the end of my "board spree". I believe 4chan now has enough covered in terms of image boards, 
				and maybe it's time to think about adding an ASCII board or just living with what is already available. Since these boards are new, they still have 
				the possibility of being deleted if they don't recieve enough traffic. Also remember because they are user managed, all e-mails concerning them should be forwarded to the appropriate 
				manager, NOT me.<br><br>
				4chan is now looking for sponsers to help with the bills. Ads in the future are possible but not yet likely. By ad I mean something around 125x50 pixels, and plain. I have NO intentions of ever adding pop-ups, flashing ads, 
				Flash layovers, etc. These ads make me want to gouge my eyes out, and I despise them as much as anyone else. I finally understand why sites need support; things aren't as cheap as they appear! As always my PayPal is still <b>moot@raspberryheaven.net</b>, 
				and my huge thanks goes out to the few people that have donated already. Don't get me wrong, donations will always be completely optional, and money should only be donated if you personally feel this site is worth it. Please also note, donating gives 
				you no special treatment, and all of the normal rules will still apply to you.<br><br>

				<td id="newsbody">Two new boards, and a host of changes!<br><br>
				One new image board added:<br>
				<a href="../y/imgboard.php">/y/ - Yaoi</a><br>
				...and a drawing board!<br>
				<a href="../404.php">4chan Oekaki BBS</a><br><br>
				Obviously the <a href="../rules.php">rules</a> have been updated to include these boards. Rules for the /c/ and /d/ boards were modified as well, be sure to check those out.<br><br>
				Now on to a few things that need addressing. Alot of people are asking me to add new boards, one for /c/ without any nudity, dedicated dix board, deciated grotesque board, and of course the trainz/farm machinery boards. 
				I'm perfectly okay with adding new boards, as long as we don't get repetitive. /c/ will stay the same, sifting through stuff won't kill you. /d/'s rules have been changed to better suit the anti-grotesque people out there. The problem with 
				making so many image boards is twofold...<br><br>
				1. <i>I don't have the cash to support so many boards. Each new board is bandwidth, and bandwidth costs MONEY! In six days, we are already 200% over the cap, at 50GB. Donations are very welcome, I use <b>moot@raspberryheaven.net</b> for PayPal.</i><br><br>
				2. <i>Adding more boards spreads out user participation too much. 4chan albeit new, and very popular for a new site, is too small of a community to support so many boards. By adding the yaoi and 
				drawing boards I'm going out on a limb, as I personally don't know how popular they will become. Prove me wrong guys.</i><br><br>
				That said, please keep the complaining for new boards and rules down. Unless it's a good idea that will attract participation, it isn't worth it right now. On a side note I'm interested in hosting boards for other communities at the moment, I talked 
				with <a href="mailto:flonne@comcast.net">Bad Luck</a>, and she convinced me a yaoi board was a good idea, and she could get enough users to build it... thus /y/ was born.<br><br>
				Still looking at ideas for what to add, as long as these ideas aren't like the examples above. If anyone knows a few artist friends or people that could help start up the oekaki board that would be great. I'm currently 
				looking for someone to run that division of 4chan, as recently I've been pressed for spare time. You can read more about that position on the <a href="../rules.php">rules</a> page.<br><br>

				The problem was the parameter for the maximum amount of log entries was too low, 500 to be exact. Effective immediately the new max for /b/ is 2000, and for all other boards, 5000. That's REALLY high! We just want to see it's effect on the

				<tr>
				<td id="newsbody">In order to resolve the rampant misconceptions and flames I'm getting on <a href="http://www.world2ch.net/">world2ch</a> (without my knowledge), I'll 
				post some quick points:<br><br>
				1. <i>4chan is a Something Awful/ADTRW run conspiracy.</i><br><br>
				Please stop mixing 4chan up with "SA's hentai forum is trying to steal our thunder!!", it's a stupid argument that is untrue. The reason that the ADTRW users outnumber the non-ADTRW users 
				is because I posted it there first, and rather than embrace this site, others are holing themselves up into what I will call "the elitist brooding state of mind" (tm).
				<br><br>
				2. <i>4chan is supposed to be ADTRW only, and consist primarily of pictures of animated children (pedo anime), with some added women and children with penises (dickgirlz).</i><br><br>
				Sorry, but no. 4chan is open to everyone, and I WANT people outside of ADTRW to use it. The quote "a comprehensive english based resource for the collection and distribution of yaoi and dickgirlz" (previous title), is 
				simply one of comical value, a kind of inside joke. Why did I choose this seemingly horrid sentence as a quote? I had no clue it would offend anybody... sorry guys, but sarcasm is prevalent on the internet as well as real life!<br><br>
				3. <i>But the /b/ image board is full of it!</i><br><br>
				If you bother to read the <a href="../rules.php">rules</a>, you'll see /b/ is meant to be nothing short of a retard bin for now. It will be changed 
				within the week. The site has existed for only two days now guys, sorry if I can't put up forty boards at once.<br><br>
				4. <i>You stole world2chan's code and didnt even plug us! How RUDE.</i><br><br>
				I never even knew futaba was public until I edited the ENTIRE code of GazouBBS (the base of futaba). I was then cheerfully informed that, all of my efforts 
				had just been wasted, as 2chan freely shares their PHP coding. Before this, I had never frequented world2ch much, and also had no clue their Eng<u>r</u>ish translation of futaba (0ch is it?) was 
				released as well. 4chan's script has been further modified (more than you can actually see), and will continue to be modified as scripters offer their help.<br><br>
				Time 4chan has had code to work with: 72 hours.<br>
				Time 2chan/world2ch has had code to work with: Years?<br><br>
				5. <i>4chan sucks, moot sucks, ADTRW sucks, SA sucks, Apis sucks...</i><br><br>
				Awsome. I whole heartedly thank those who have e-mailed me voicing their opinions and concerns (to date: <b>0</b>) regarding 4chan. Furthermore, posting threads on another board is the best way 
				to attract my attention, keep at it. (If you haven't noticed, this is the "sarcasm" I was talking about earlier)<br><br>
				6. <i>You're immature, and this response has done nothing to sway my opinion.</i><br><br>
				If this is the way some of you are thinking right now, I am truly sorry for you. The above is meant to be my serious response (as anything posted on the main page will be), 
				to the discontent peoples of world2ch and abroad. For the tenth time I will reiterate: E-MAIL ME. If you're either too immature or incompetant to have a real two-way conversation 
				with me, without hiding behind the magic of the internet, you very well could be an idiot. If the previous is true, please do not waste my time, or your time... by e-mailing me I am requesting 
				a decent piece of writing sent to me outlaying your concerns, suggestions, or questions. Please refrain from sending me "WORLD2CH ALLIANCE WILL CRUSH YOU", as I have just stated you are an idiot.<br><br><br>
				I hope that clears some things up. You can read my previous response on world2ch's ongoing thread (as well as my host's) <a href="http://world2ch.net/test/read.cgi/pc/1064495162/">here</a>.

				<td id="newsbody">Greeting 4chan users!<br><br>
				
				As you can see, 4chan now has a nice mainpage up. With this, I can now post the updates and plans I had previously been withholding...
				Let me start off by posting a little about 4chan:<br><br>
				4chan is meant to be an unofficial sister site to <a href="http://www.2chan.net/">2chan.net</a>, an amazing Japanese community that has been around for a long time.
				This website, while similar to it's Japanese counterpart, is NOT trying to replace 2chan... that's simply impossible. 4chan is merely bringing
				to the table, what English speaking people have lacked for a while; a diverse community united around the simple thousand line piece of PHP
				code that we call tagboard. Our site is meant to be an equal alternative for non-Japanese speaking persons to interact as they would on 2chan, with
				an active and diverse community. The road to becoming a full fledged sister-site will be a long and difficult one, however I believe that with
				the help of a few dedicated individuals, and a large, helpful, friendly community, greatness can be achieved. <br><br>
				Everyone is equally welcomed at this website, as long as you keep your drama and warring elsewhere. By trying to start flamewars between 2chan, <a href="http://www.world2ch.net/">world2ch</a>, and 
				4chan, you're just hurting the web-based English anime community. Please don't do it, you have nothing to gain, and others end up losing out. That said, if you enjoy this site,
				tell your friends! Both English and Japanese users are again, *equally*, welcomed here if they meet the above requirement.
				<br><br>
				Please bear with us as we get the site online.
				ALL feedback is valued, and I'll try my best to get around to looking at it. The only way this site will improve and hopefully flourish, is with constant
				user input on how it should be run. I've already asked several people to help out, and am still looking for a few more dedicated individuals to help out with 
				4chan. If you think you have what it takes (PHP coders wanted), shoot me an email!<br><br>
				That said, enjoy the boards!<br><br>
				<b>Edit for the world2ch crew:</b> Don't worry, there is no plan to put up several inactive sports and political forums. This will be largely image and comedy based, we have no 
				intention of partaking in intelligent discussions concerning foreign affairs. By sister-site, I mean focusing primarily on certain likable aspects of 2chan, not just a mirror. Your territory is safe.<br><br>
				
				I only say this after I politely asked people not to post stupid stuff on these boards, and to take any problems or concerns directly to me in the form of e-mail.
